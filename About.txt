1] In this application, main two components are the list of pokemons' names (20 on one page)
and pagination which alows us to go forward and backward through th pages available.

2] Axios is a library used to fetch from api which makes it easier 
than default fetch from the browser.

3] Names are fetched from pokeapi.

4] UseEffect is used so that if anything in the application
changes, the content inside the UseEffect function re-renders
only once.

5] <> </> must be used when returning more than one object,
because otherwise javascript allows to return only one 
object.
